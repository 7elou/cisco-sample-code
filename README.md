# Cisco Sample Code

_License, Examples and Project Templates to enable Cisco resources to produce and share Cisco Sample Code_

## Cisco Sample Code License

This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

**License:**  For all Sample Code postings*, you must include a copy of the _Cisco Sample Code License_ in a [LICENSE](./LICENSE) text file in the root of the repository.

**Header:**  You must include the Cisco copyright and license notice [HEADER](./HEADER) in _every source code file_ (see the [Templates](./templates) folder for language specific examples of how this should be done).

_*Note:  For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text)._


## Examples

To make getting started as simple as possible, we have provided some language and use-case specific [examples](./examples).


## Docs

We have also provided examples for some common project [docs](./docs) (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.).


## Project Templates
 _**Coming Soon:**_  We are working to provide some project-stem templates (like [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)) using the new Cisco Sample Code License and the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) tool.
