# Cisco Sample Code
_License and Code Templates to enable Cisco resources to produce and share Sample Code_

## Cisco Sample Code License
This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

**License:**  For all Sample Code postings*, you must include a copy of the _Cisco Sample Code License_ in a [LICENSE](./LICENSE) text file in the root of the repository.

**Header:**  You must include the Cisco copyright and license notice [HEADER](./HEADER) in _every source code file_ (see the [Templates](./templates) folder for language specific examples of how this should be done).

_*Note:  For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text)._


## Examples
To make getting started as simple as possible, we have provided some language and use-specific [examples](./examples).

## Templates _-Coming Soon!_
We are working to provide some project-stem templates (like [audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)) using the new Cisco Sample Code License and the [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

If you would like to help in this effort, please contact chrlunsf@cisco.com.
