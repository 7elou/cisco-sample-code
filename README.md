# Cisco Sample Code
_License and Code Templates to enable Cisco resources to produce and share Sample Code_

## Cisco Sample Code License
This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

### License
For all postings* of Sample Code, you must include a copy of the _Cisco Sample Code License_ in a [LICENSE](./LICENSE) text file in the root of the repository.

_***Note:**  For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text)._


### Header
You must include the following Cisco copyright and license notice [HEADER](./HEADER) in _every source code file_ (see the [Templates](./Templates) folder for language specific examples of how this should be done).


## Templates
To make getting started as simple as possible, we have provided some language and use-case specific [Templates](./Templates).

_**Don't see a Template for your language or use case?**_

Here are the essential elements:

**Required**
 * The Cisco Sample Code License [header text](./HEADER) **must be included at the top of every source code file** (in a comment, docstring or other appropriate metadata element).

 * The copyright year in the header should be updated to the current year (the year the code is first published).

 * Never include your own name in the copyright notice.  You absolutely may elsewhere indicate that you are the author of the code (just not in the copyright notice).

**Optional but Recommended**

In a comment, docstring or other appropriate metadata element include the following information for your project:

 * **Author** - The author's name and e-mail address.

 * **Contributors** - The names and e-mail addresses of the individuals who have contributed in creating the sample code.

 * **Maintainers** - If different from the author and contributors, the names and e-mail addresses of the individuals who maintain the sample code.

 * **License** - If a license metadata field is available, please include the license name that the code is licensed under:  `Cisco Sample Code License, Version 1.0`

 * **Copyright** - If a copyright metadata field is available, please include the copyright notice:  `Copyright (c) <current year> Cisco and/or its affiliates.`

 If you create a Template for a language or use case that we haven't included here and you feel it would help others, please submit a pull request with the additional template.
